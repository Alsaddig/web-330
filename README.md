This course examines intermediate and advanced JavaScript concepts and techniques.  Topics include advanced functions, asynchronous executions, jQuery design patterns, MVC (Model-View-Controller) with Backbone.js, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Knockout.js, and single-page applications. Projects utilize these topics in an intensive, hands-on style format to build enterprise level solutions.  GitHub is used for the coordination and sharing of individual and group projects.
